# advanced-document-search
This app extends Document Search functionality in Document Capture by a Preview and fields value overview

The user has now an easy overview of the current selected document without need to open the Document Card or download the related file
![Advanced Document Search with Preview ](https://github.com/document-capture/advanced-document-search/blob/main/res/images/Advanced-Document-Search.png?raw=true)

Furthermore the user can see document related field values in the bottom of the page to e.g. see directly the net amount, invoice date or other important information.
The fields that should be shown to the user can be configured on the the Master templates of the document categories.
